Python operators and examples
    Python operators are special symbols that are used to perform operations on one or more operands (value, variables, or expressions).
    
    The types of operators include Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators, Assignment Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators,
    Membership Operators and Identity Operators

    Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. e.g. a+b , a/basic

    Comparison operators compare the values on either side of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called Relational operators. e.g >, <, !=, ==

    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. E.g. a*=10 is the same as a=a*10

    Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and check the final result. e.g. a and b , a or b

    Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit by bit operation. These operators are used to compare binary numbers. E.g. a & b

    Membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples. e.g. character in characters

    Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects. e.g. a is not b
